# G-Tweaks
This is just my old G-Tweaks ported to typescript *essentially*.
Everything inside is fairly easily understood (aside from my lacking knowledge of typescript. I swear this is the first time ive used it. hopefully ill get better)

I'll just come out and say it ahead of time: I dont like being tied down to a project, and hence I will probably very rarely do updates on this project (just somewhat periodically / randomly).
If you want to submit a pull request or whatever, thats fine go for it. If you have discord I've setup a [community server](https://discord.gg/8PF5rmMt2X) for support and stuff. 

### Disclamers
> Don't trust random people on the internet.
> I have a full time job outside of this. This is just a side project / hobby (dont expect frequent updates). That being said, I still intend on making this *fairly* robust.
> I personally use [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/) + [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) for everything, so if it doesnt work for you it might be platform dependant (sorry). 

### Installation (the fun stuff)
For installation I would follow [these steps](./dist/installation.md)
