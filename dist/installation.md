### Installation Methods
If you have you have a userscript manager already setup, [heres the direct link](./userscript.inline.js?raw=true)
There are other files for debugging purposes (or you just don't trust minified code from a random) you can use the other userscript versions that I've written build steps for.
The main reason I wrote them to minify is for file size. If you want the "best of both worlds" the [min.js](./userscript.min.js?raw=true) is probably the best, as it has a very small file size. And has a sourcemapURL link for debugging. 

Later on I'll be making a list of installation methods for users (including those who dont use userscript managers)
Since everything i've written is actually just a glorified console script.
